# Lane Detection with Deep Learning | OpenCV | Keras

## Overview
This project demonstrates a lane detection system that processes video frames to identify lane markings using a deep learning model. Using a pre-trained model built with Keras, the application reads each frame from a video, detects lane boundaries, and overlays the detected lanes back onto the frames. This project combines computer vision with deep learning to provide accurate lane detection, which can be useful for self-driving or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

## Key Features
- **Pre-trained Model for Lane Detection**: Uses a deep learning model trained to detect lane markings in road scenes.
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Processes each frame in the input video and generates an output video with detected lane markings.
- **Customizable Pre- and Post-Processing**: Includes functions to preprocess input frames and post-process model predictions for optimized lane detection.
- **OpenCV for Video Handling**: Uses OpenCV to read video frames, process them, and save the output video with detected lanes.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deep Learning Model**: Pre-trained lane detection model (expected to be stored at `model.h5`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Example Usage
This example demonstrates lane detection on a sample road video, where detected lanes are overlaid on the original frames and saved as a new video file.
